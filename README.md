# SinatraShoppingList
### A shopping list application using Sinatra. 

This is a full-stack MVC application in Sinatra complete with **models**, **controllers**, and **views**!

While the ApplicationController handles starting the app, the ItemsController allows for modifications as it contains functionality for:

- **C**reate
- **R**ead
- **U**pdate
- **D**estroy

As a result, users are able to not only create a shopping list of items/goods they need to purchase, but they are able to modify those
same lists by creating new items, editing item and/or quanitity, or deleting items.

#### Happy List Making!!
